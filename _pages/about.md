## 🚀 About Me

I’m passionate about modeling complex systems — from the magnetic structures of the Sun to the price dynamics of financial markets. My academic journey began with **computational astrophysics**, where I worked on 3D reconstruction of solar eruptions and high-resolution MHD simulations. Along the way, I developed a deep interest in **financial market modeling**, where similar tools — simulation, statistical learning, system thinking — apply in entirely new ways.

## 📈 Quantitative Research

- **IMC Global Trading Challenge (2025)**  
  Developed a volatility arbitrage strategy and a dynamic regime-switching system under real-time constraints. Achieved **1st place in the Hong Kong region**, 2nd in China among 4,000+ teams (in the 3rd round).

- **Interests**:  
  - Alpha Signal Research (equities, fixed income)  
  - Market Microstructure & Execution  
  - Online Machine Learning in Quantitative Trading

## 🌞 Astrophysics Research

- **3D Structure of Solar Eruptions**  
  Led an undergraduate research program focused on reconstructing the 3D velocity field and magnetic structure of solar prominences using CHASE satellite data.
  
- **MHD Simulation of Solar Flux Ropes**  
  Applied the MPI-AMRVAC 3.0 codebase to simulate nonlinear magnetofrictional evolution of eruptive solar magnetic fields.

- **Solar Differential Rotation via Remote Sensing**  
  Used time-series image analysis techniques to study solar rotational asymmetry and latitudinal flows.

These experiences shaped my understanding of dynamic systems, data uncertainty, and simulation fidelity — skills that now inform my work in quantitative modeling.
